# Roadmap Contentes

This comprehensive repository encompasses a PDF file containing a thorough roadmap to Computer Science Foundations. It serves as an extensive guide to strengthen
your capabilities and skills, empowering you to choose any technology track you wish to delve into—whether it be AI, Cybersecurity, Web Development, and more.
This ensures that you can embark on your learning journey without the need to frequently revisit the foundational aspects of the road."
# Roadmap Objectives

The roadmap primarily emphasizes establishing a strong foundation in programming, mathematics relevant to CS, cybersecurity, and the development of complete systems. 
# Roadmap Materials

It consolidates material from two well-known online roadmaps, namely OSSU and Teachyourselfcs. They mainly consistes of Top World Universities courses (such as MIT, berkeley,..etc) 
Additionally, I have incorporated exceptional Arabic courses to enhance the overall learning experience and facilitate a better understanding of the material.
There are two types of materials in this repository: books and courses. Each type is distinguished by a different color code. Additionally, for each book or course, a link is provided to either the online course or the Amazon page of the book.
This facilitates easy tracking of your learning progress with the respective materials.
# Roadmap Categorization

I've organized the content following a similar categorization as found in OSSU's major topics. For instance, I've segmented all the fundamentals into distinct sections such as math, programming, and more.
"Within these broad categories, I further subdivide each into essential subtopics labeled as 'core'—these are obligatory and form the foundational knowledge. Conversely, there are advanced subtopics labeled as 'advanced,
' which are optional. It is recommended to choose these advanced subtopics based on your specific needs and requirements for mastering the selected technology track.
